                    <h1>Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.</h1>
        <p>I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice. I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman.</p>
        <p>Dear Mr. President, There 
        are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P. S. I am not a crackpot. Duffman can't breathe! OH NO! <strong> Brace yourselves gentlemen.</strong> <em> According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is… Love!?</em> Who's been screwing with this thing?</p>
        <h2>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</h2>
        <p>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico?</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Jesus must be spinning in his grave!</li><li>You don't win friends with salad.</li><li>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity…</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency.</h3>
        <p>Human contact: the final frontier. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I hope I didn't brain my damage.</li><li>I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.</li><li>They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day.</li>
        </ul>
        <a href="#">Mon lien</a>
        <p>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie.</p>
        <p>Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. You don't win friends with salad. Me fail English? That's unpossible.</p>
        <p>Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get. I hope I didn't brain my damage. "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.</p>
        <p>Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. I stand by my racial slur. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</p>
        <p>I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies. You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity.</p>
        <p>Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about! I was saying "Boo-urns." Homer no function beer well without. Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?</p>
        <p>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</p>
        <p>You don't win friends with salad. Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems.</p>
        <p>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun. Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk.</p>
        <p>Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Beer. Now there's a temporary solution.</p>
        <p>"Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion. You don't win friends with salad.</p>
